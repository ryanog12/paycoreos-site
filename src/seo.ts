> ${COMPANY}. PaycoreOS places call centers, online stores, retailers, and restaurants into merchant processing, point of sale, and Visa and Mastercard dispute defense. One application. The form matches the business. A real person submits it.

PaycoreOS has done this work since 2013. The application fee is $39. It is charged only after the form, and it is not collected until the fee account is ready. PaycoreOS does not publish a processing rate.

## Who it is for

Business owners who need a merchant account approved and then kept in good standing, and businesses that already accept cards and want dispute defense only. The processing categories are call centers, eCommerce, retail, and restaurants. A new business needs a legal entity, a business bank account, and an owner ID. Dispute defense is its own service for a business that already accepts cards. It does not open a new processing account.

## Services

- Merchant processing for call centers, online stores, retail, and restaurants
- Payment gateway and hosted checkout. PaycoreOS is a reseller of the Authorize.Net gateway and the NMI gateway. Those are gateways, not processors.
- Virtual terminal, payment links, invoicing by email or text, and recurring billing
- Point of sale: counter terminal, handheld terminal, and tap to pay on a phone. A Clover terminal the business already owns can be connected. PaycoreOS does not ship a new Clover unit.
- Dispute defense for businesses that already accept cards: Visa Order Insight, Rapid Dispute Resolution, the Cardholder Dispute Resolution Network, Resolve, and Compelling Evidence 3.0; Mastercard Ethoca Alerts and Ethoca Consumer Clarity. Enrollment asks for the current processor, descriptor, website, merchant ID (MID), and card acceptor ID (CAID).
- Surcharging and dual pricing as programs a business can ask about
- Applications after a bank decline. PaycoreOS still submits the application. Most underwriting decisions within 24–72 business hours. That is not a promise of approval. The merchant names the bank. A decline notice is optional. PaycoreOS does not tell the merchant which company receives the file.
